=== Little Corner

Little Corner is a drop-in PHP site that provides your own personal hub-type website that automatically pulls information in from many mainstream sites and services.  The site is built on CodeIgniter (2.0.2), which is included in the project.

This is an early release, so there's still a lot of customization that hasn't been added in yet & everything is still quite hard-coded into the site itself.

* A Twitter account
* A Foursquare account
